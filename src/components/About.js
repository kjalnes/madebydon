                <p> Don is a character. A native New Yorker. Anyone who’s a regular in the West Village knows Don. He loves jazz. Knows all about jazz. He’s got an atlas he has put together himself, consisting of his favorite pages of several atlases, collected in a handmade red leather binding. He knows where to get the best priced beers in the tristate area (60 cents per can off of the New Jersey turnpike), and he reuses everything he possibly can.
                </p>
                <p> Don was born in Bay Ridge in Brooklyn in 1930 and grew up in a big Italian family as one out of eight kids. The Girardi family ran an ice cream store, making all the ice cream in large wooden barrels. In his early 20s Don was shipped out to serve in the Korean war, journeying there across the oceans for 32 days, and returned from there having seen the world and experienced the depressions of war. For a while he took office work up on Madison Avenue in the advertisement industry but he later quit because they made him wear a tie. So he became a leather maker. In the 1960s Don took a job working for a local leather maker in the West Village where he learned to master the trade. Eventually he opened his own shop right below the apartment where he still lives today on Bleecker street. He called the shop the Leather Man. In those days Don would stay up in his studio above the shop into the early hours making bags and reengineering designs, just for the love of working with leather. The Leather Man was always filled with his entourage of friends. At one point he handed his keys to a friend and took off for Europe where he bought an English taxi cab that he wound up driving around for a couple of years, picking up fellow wanderers on the way. He eventually came back to the city where he took up the leather craft once again. In his late twenties Don suffered a terrible motorcycle accident on 6th Avenue. He spent two years in the hospital recovering, while watching the Verrazano Bridge being built from his hospital window. As he recovered he returned to the Village where he for the past 50 years have been making leather products. His beautifully hand crafted bags and backpacks are loved by people from all over the world, and he still makes all his bags in his leather workshop overlooking Bleecker street, his residence since 1969. Today walking into Don’s apartment of 47 years is like entering a museum, only better, with layers of colorful artwork, jazz records, historical books, piles of newspapers and decades of stories of times passed in the Village.

                <p>Don has stories about customers returning to Bleecker street years and decades later, still wearing his bags. His bags travel all over, he says. This is why we (Don’s friends and devoted bag fans) have joined forces to set up this webshop so his bags can reach even more people.

                <span className='custom-title-1'>About Don’s bags</span>
                <p>All of the bags are made of quality cowhide and pig skin. He uses full grain cow hide which means that the surface of the leather has not been sanded down and coated, but carries the natural features of the hide. This allows the leather to age beautifully, since no artificial “coating” will peel off as is the case with much leather products today.
                </p>
                Full grain is the best leather money can buy. It comes from the top layer of the hide which has ALL of the grain, therefore, FULL grain. The natural surface of full grain leather burnishes and beautifies with use. It also means that each individual bag is unique, which is how leather products used to be before it got industrialized through factory production.

                <p>All the materials are bought in the Garment District of New York, also known back in the day as the Schmatta District, says Don.
